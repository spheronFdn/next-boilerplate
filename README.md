# Next Boilerplate

## Introduction

This next boilerplate is modified to meet the requirement for deploying on Decentralized networks like IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave, etc. We have added all the necessary configuration to get you fast track you development on decentralised protocol without much effort.

This boilerplate is optimized explicitly for Spheron deployments, and we highly recommend using Spheron to ship your project. So GTFOL ðŸš€

> **_NOTE:_** You might have noticed that we have added some extra config for production in this boilerplate. These configuration are needed to safely deploy your dapp on decentralised storage network, we recommend not removing this.
